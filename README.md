# Artificial_Bee_Colony

Algorithm Explanation:

there is 2 classes: abc/bee
abc class is were the algorithm starts, with bees
bee class is actually represents each solution that has data and fitness

"employed bees":
1- we make some random valid solutions (bees) (in amount of the of the "population number")
2- for each "bee" we do the "cross-over" and "mutation", one time (if doing the "cross-over" or "mutation" does not make improvement, we only add one to "improvement_try" property of that bee, if it does make improvement, we replace it with the original "bee" and make "improvement_try" property of this "new_bee" to zero )


"onlooker bees":
1- we choose a "bee" by "roulette wheel" procedure (we make sure that, the "improvement_try" property of that bee, be less than the "max_improvement_try" vriable) (we do this in amount of "RW_iteration" variable)
2- we pass the choosen "bee" to "try_for_improvement"
3- in "try_for_improvement" we do "cross-over" and "mutation"
4- in "cross-over" we select a random position and random neighbor (the neighbor must not be equal to itself) - we replace this "new_bee "to the original one, if and only if it be valid and had improvement
5- in "mutation" we select a random position, and random target (0, 1) - we replace this "new_bee "to the original one, if and only if it be valid and had improvement
6- we check that if doing cross-over and mutation had made any change or not, for any bee that change has be made, we add one to that bee's "improvement_try" property
7- if the last section, executes (adding one), we pass that bee to "_scout_check", to check that if the bee has reached to "max_improvement_try" or not
8- if in last section, if the bee has reached to "max_improvement_try", we pass it to "scout_bees"
to make a random valid new bee and add it to our "population"


"scout bees":
1- here we make brand new bees and add it to our population

  this is the classic version
    we do not have the modified or heuristic part here

this version has the changes that dad has made

and 

editing for getting tuning runs + (tournoment)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in this version we have added analysis out put excel and param tuning word file in tunning folder
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
editing the final input excel
the part of code that makes the final excel
